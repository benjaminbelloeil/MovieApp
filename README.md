## Requirements

- iOS 14.0+
- Xcode 12.0+
- Swift 5.3+

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MovieApp.git
   cd MovieApp
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   Ensure that you have the necessary tools and libraries installed:

   - Xcode
   - SwiftUI (comes with Xcode)

3. **Configure the API Key**

   The app uses TMDb API to fetch movie data. You need to obtain an API key from [TMDb](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) and set it up in the project.

   - Open `MovieViewModel.swift`
   - Replace the `apiKey` property with your own TMDb API key:
     ```swift
     private let apiKey = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["MOVIE_API_KEY"] ?? ""
     ```

4. **Run the App**

   Open the project in Xcode and press `Cmd + R` to build and run the app on a simulator or connected device.

## Usage

- **Home Screen**: The home screen displays a list of popular movies. Tap on a movie to view its details.
- **Movie Details**: On the details screen, you can read more about the movie, including its rating, release date, and a brief overview. Tap the heart icon in the top right corner of the movie poster to mark it as a favorite.
